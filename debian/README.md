# MADlib Debian Packaging

## Overview

`.deb` packages are built by the top-level `package.mk` (via `debuild`),
which hands off to `debian/rules` for the actual `dh` sequence. This is a
**single-package** source tree — one binary package plus the automatically
generated `-dbgsym` companion:

| Package | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)-madlib` | MADlib extension: `libmadlib.so`, `madlib--<ver>.sql`, `madlib.control`, Python modules under `share/postgresql/madlib/modules` |
| `greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)-madlib-dbgsym` | Debug symbols, produced by `dh_strip` (`.ddeb`) |

Because there is only one binary package, debhelper uses the **default
file names** without a package prefix: `debian/install`,
`debian/lintian-overrides`, `debian/copyright`,
`debian/compat`, `debian/rules`. No `debian/<pkg>.install` variants.

## Requirements / Environment Variables

| Variable | Enforced by | Required? | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GP_MAJORVERSION` | `package.mk` (all goals except `help`, `version-info`), `debian/rules` (always) | Yes | — | Drives the package name (`greengage<GP_MAJORVERSION>-madlib`), `PG_HOME`, and the `@GP_MAJORVERSION@` substitution in `debian/control.in` |
| `PG_HOME` | `debian/rules` | No | `/opt/greengagedb/greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)` | Greengage install prefix; `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` for the build, base for `@PG_HOME_REL@` substitution |
| `PG_CONFIG` | `debian/rules` | No | `$(PG_HOME)/bin/pg_config` | Must be runnable and report `Greengage <GP_MAJORVERSION>` via `--gp_version`; passed to CMake as `-DGREENGAGE_<GP_MAJORVERSION>_PG_CONFIG`, so only that Greengage port is built; its `--pkglibdir`/`--sharedir` define the install layout |
| `DEB_PACKAGES` | `package.mk` | No | `Package/<package>_<version>` | Overrides the final output directory (used by CI) |
| `MADLIB_PACKAGE_VERSION` | `package.mk` | No | — | Explicit version override, takes priority over git and `.version` |

`ci/build_in_docker.sh` determines `GP_MAJORVERSION` from the
Greengage developer image and derives `PG_HOME` from it. It also installs
the build dependencies missing from the image (`greengage<N>`,
`python3-yaml`).

## Build Flow

```text
GP_MAJORVERSION=6 make -f package.mk pkg
                    ↓
debian/control  (generated from debian/control.in,
                  substituting @GP_MAJORVERSION@)
                    ↓
debian/changelog (single entry; package name/maintainer
                   read from debian/control.in)
                    ↓
debuild --preserve-env -us -uc -b
   (PG_HOME, GP_MAJORVERSION exported explicitly)
                    ↓
debian/rules: dh sequence
                    ↓
override_dh_auto_configure
   (render install.in → debian/install;
    hand off to CMake with -DGREENGAGE_<N>_PG_CONFIG)
                    ↓
override_dh_auto_build
   (make extension: libmadlib.so, madlib--<ver>.sql, modules/)
                    ↓
override_dh_auto_install
   (copy the extension-install layout into debian/tmp)
                    ↓
dh_install (filters debian/tmp through debian/install)
                    ↓
dh_strip → .ddeb, dh_installchangelogs, dh_lintian, dh_builddeb
                    ↓
rm -rf $(PACKAGE_DIR) && mkdir -p $(PACKAGE_DIR)
                    ↓
mv of exact filenames:
   <package>_<version>_*.<deb|ddeb>
   <source>_<version>_*.<build|buildinfo|changes>
   → $(PACKAGE_DIR)/  (default: ./Package/greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)-madlib_$(PACKAGE_VERSION))
```

## package.mk Targets

### Informational (no `GP_MAJORVERSION` required)

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `help` | Prints usage and the list of targets |
| `version-info` | Prints the resolved package version and build metadata |

Every other target hard-fails if `GP_MAJORVERSION` is unset or empty:

```text
package.mk:16: *** GP_MAJORVERSION must be set.  Stop.
```

### Version

The package version is resolved from `MADLIB_PACKAGE_VERSION`, then
`git describe --tags`, then `.version`. If none of them yields a value,
`0.0.0+unknown` is used (with a warning).

A leading non-numeric tag prefix is stripped (`rel/v2.2.0` → `2.2.0`).
Git development versions in the form `<version>-<commits>-<hash>` are
converted to `<version>+dev.<commits>.<hash>` for Debian packaging.

### Control / changelog generation

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `debian/control` | Generated from `debian/control.in`, substituting `@GP_MAJORVERSION@` |
| `changelog` / `debian/changelog` | Generates a single-entry changelog using the resolved package version and the package name/maintainer read out of `debian/control.in` |

### Packaging

| Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pkg` | Alias for `pkg-deb` — the entry point used by `ci/build_in_docker.sh` |
| `pkg-deb` | Depends on `debian/changelog` and `debian/control`. Runs `debuild --preserve-env -us -uc -b` (binary-only, unsigned), scoped via `DH_OPTIONS="-p greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)-madlib"` with `PG_HOME`/`GP_MAJORVERSION` exported into the debuild environment; then wipes `$(PACKAGE_DIR)`, recreates it, and moves exact filenames (`<package>_<version>_*.<deb\|ddeb>` and `<source>_<version>_*.<build\|buildinfo\|changes>`) from the parent directory into it |

A `.debuilder.lock` directory (created with `mkdir`, atomic) guards
against concurrent `pkg-deb` runs in the same working tree.

`MAINTAINER` and `PACKAGE_SOURCE` (used to build `debian/changelog` and
the `PACKAGE_DEBIAN` package name) are read via `grep`/`awk` from
**`debian/control.in`** (the template), not from the generated
`debian/control` — this works because neither field contains
`@GP_MAJORVERSION@`, so the values are identical in both files.

`debian/control` and `debian/changelog` are declared `.PHONY` in
`package.mk`, so they are regenerated on every `make -f package.mk pkg`
invocation regardless of file timestamps. This matters because their
content depends on the `GP_MAJORVERSION` environment variable, not on
`debian/control.in`'s mtime — without `.PHONY`, rebuilding a different
`GP_MAJORVERSION` in the same working directory right after another run
would silently reuse the stale `debian/control` from the previous run.

## debian/rules

| Override | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `dh_auto_configure` | Fails if `PG_CONFIG` is not runnable or doesn't report `Greengage $(GP_MAJORVERSION)`; renders `debian/install` from `install.in` via `sed`; calls `dh_auto_configure` (CMake, build directory `build/`) with `-DGREENGAGE_$(GP_MAJORVERSION)_PG_CONFIG` and `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` |
| `dh_auto_build` | Builds the `extension` target only. The default `all`/`install` targets produce the madpack layout (`/usr/local/madlib/Versions/...`), which is not packaged |
| `dh_auto_install` | The upstream `extension-install` target copies straight into the live `pg_config` directories and has no `DESTDIR` support, so its layout is reproduced by hand under `debian/tmp`: `libmadlib.so` → `--pkglibdir`; `madlib.control`, `madlib--<ver>.sql` → `--sharedir/extension`; `modules/` → `--sharedir/madlib/modules` (this path is baked into the generated SQL as `PLPYTHON_LIBDIR`) |

`debian/rules` hard-fails on missing `GP_MAJORVERSION` and on a
`PG_CONFIG` that cannot run or whose `--gp_version` doesn't match
`GP_MAJORVERSION`.

## Install Manifest

`debian/install` (generated from `debian/install.in`) whitelists what goes
into the package, under `@PG_HOME_REL@`: `lib/postgresql/*`,
`share/postgresql/extension/*` and `share/postgresql/madlib/*`. The
default, unprefixed name is valid because there is exactly one binary
package. It is generated at configure time in
`override_dh_auto_configure` so it can be templated by `GP_MAJORVERSION`.

## Lintian Overrides

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `debian/lintian-overrides` | `dir-or-file-in-opt` (Greengage install layout under `/opt` is expected) |

The unprefixed name is used because there is a single binary package.
`dh_lintian` picks it up as the default override file for that package.

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `package.mk` | Version, control/changelog generation, packaging targets |
| `ci/build_in_docker.sh` | Runs the full build inside a Greengage container image |
| `ci/build_in_docker_local.sh` | Wrapper for local development (see Usage below) |
| `.version` | Fallback package version, used when neither `MADLIB_PACKAGE_VERSION` nor a git tag is available; populated at `git archive` time via `.gitattributes` |
| `debian/control.in` | `debian/control` template, substituting `@GP_MAJORVERSION@` |
| `debian/rules` | Debhelper overrides |
| `debian/install.in` | Install manifest template, rendered per `GP_MAJORVERSION` |
| `debian/lintian-overrides` | Suppressed lintian warnings |
| `debian/copyright` | Debian copyright file (Apache-2.0) |
| `debian/compat` | Debhelper compat level (13) |

Generated (do not commit, `.gitignore`d): `debian/control`,
`debian/changelog`, `debian/install`.

## Usage

### Local build in a container (recommended)

The recommended way to build a package locally is to use the
`ci/build_in_docker_local.sh` wrapper. It runs the build inside the
matching Greengage developer image, so the Greengage build toolchain
does not need to be installed on the host.

```bash
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh
```

The default configuration is Greengage 6 on Ubuntu 22.04. Greengage and
Ubuntu versions can be specified explicitly:

```bash
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh 6 24.04
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh 7 22.04
```

The `ci/build_in_docker.sh` script determines the Greengage major version
from the developer image and runs the package build as the owner of the
mounted source tree, avoiding root-owned build artifacts. The script
must be run as root inside the Greengage developer image and is not
intended for direct execution on a host system.

By default, resulting `.deb`/`.ddeb`/`.build`/`.buildinfo`/`.changes`
land in `./Package/greengage$(GP_MAJORVERSION)-madlib_$(PACKAGE_VERSION)/`.
The output directory can be overridden with `DEB_PACKAGES` (CI uses this
to write into a flat, version-tagged directory that matches the upload
step and the shared `tests/install/deb` action).

### Local build on a host with Greengage installed

```bash
export GP_MAJORVERSION=6
export PG_HOME=/opt/greengagedb/greengage${GP_MAJORVERSION}

make -f package.mk pkg
make -f package.mk version-info
```

Use `GP_MAJORVERSION=7` to build the package for Greengage 7.

`GP_MAJORVERSION` must be set for every target except `help` and
`version-info`. You can pass it either via the environment
(`GP_MAJORVERSION=6 make -f package.mk pkg`) or as a make variable
(`make -f package.mk GP_MAJORVERSION=6 pkg`) — both work.

### Notes

* `debian/control` and `debian/changelog` are **generated on every
  build** (declared `.PHONY` in `package.mk`, see above) from
  `debian/control.in` and the current `GP_MAJORVERSION`/package version.
  `debian/install` is generated at configure time from its `.in`
  template. All three are `.gitignore`d and should
  not be committed.
* `override_dh_auto_install` populates `debian/tmp`, and `dh_install`
  filters that directory through `debian/install`. Anything present in
  `debian/tmp` but not matched by `debian/install` will abort the build
  via `dh_missing`.
