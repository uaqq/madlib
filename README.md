=================================================
**MADlib<sup>&reg;</sup>** is an open-source library for scalable in-database analytics.
It provides data-parallel implementations of mathematical, statistical and
machine learning methods for structured and unstructured data.

[![Build Status](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/job/madlib2-master/badge/icon)](https://ci-builds.apache.org/job/Madlib/job/madlib-build/job/madlib2-master/)

Installation and Contribution
==============================
See the project website  [MADlib Home](http://madlib.apache.org/) for links to the
latest binary and source packages.

We appreciate all forms of project contributions to MADlib including bug reports, providing help to new users, documentation, or code patches. Please refer to [Contribution Guidelines](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/Contribution+Guidelines) for instructions.

For more installation and contribution guides,
please refer to the [MADlib Wiki](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/).

[Compiling from source on Linux](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MADLIB/Installation+Guide#InstallationGuide-CompileFromSourceCompilingFromSource) details are
also on the wiki.

Detailed build instructions are available in [`ReadMe_Build.txt`](ReadMe_Build.txt)

Building a DEB package
======================
`.deb` packages of the MADlib extension (`CREATE EXTENSION madlib`) are
built per Greengage major version using debhelper (`debian/`,
`package.mk`), not `cpack`. See [debian/README.md](debian/README.md) for
the full packaging reference (environment variables, generated files,
build flow).

Local build in a container (recommended — no need to install the
Greengage build toolchain on the host):

```
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh
```

The wrapper accepts two optional arguments: the Greengage major version
and the Ubuntu version. Defaults are 6 / 22.04.

Examples:

```
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh 6 24.04
ci/build_in_docker_local.sh 7 22.04
```

Local build on a host with Greengage already installed:

```
export GP_MAJORVERSION=6
export PG_HOME=/opt/greengagedb/greengage${GP_MAJORVERSION}

make -f package.mk pkg
```

Resulting `.deb`, `.ddeb`, `.build`, `.buildinfo`, and `.changes` land
in `./Package/greengage${GP_MAJORVERSION}-madlib_${PACKAGE_VERSION}/`.
The output directory can be overridden with `DEB_PACKAGES`.

CI builds the same set via `.github/workflows/build_and_package.yml`,
running `ci/build_in_docker.sh` inside the matching Greengage developer
image (`ghcr.io/greengagedb/greengage/ggdb<version>_<os>`). The matrix
of supported `gp_version` / `target_os_version` combinations lives in
that workflow.
